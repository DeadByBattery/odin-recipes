        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Vanilla is frequently used to flavor ice cream, especially in North America, Asia, and Europe. Vanilla ice
            cream, like other flavors of ice cream, was originally created by cooling a mixture made of cream, sugar,
            and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. The type of vanilla used to flavor ice cream varies by
            location. In North America and Europe consumers are interested in a more prominent, smoky flavor, while in
            Ireland they want a more anise-like flavor. To create the smooth consistency of ice cream, the mixture has
            to be stirred occasionally and then returned to the container of ice and salt to continue the solidification
            process. According to Iced: 180 Very Cool Concoctions, many people often consider vanilla to be the
            "default" or "plain" flavor of ice cream.
